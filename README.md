**Please Note** :

## 1. Description
#### What is this project and why does it exist?

I loved the tutorial and I would like to do it again. Hopefully improve on it and add more content on top. 
After each video of the tutorial, the repo is going to be updated, with the progress. Details of the updates will be found under the [ Changelog ](#changelog) category.
- Given that it is a short tutorial (9 videos, about 10 to 25 mins each), there are some bugs and issues here and there that I'd  like to address and fix. 

**Please Note**:
- I'm using Unity version 2021.2.18f1;
- You can download the assets used in this tutorial [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/juihs7yq93x1aon/GPJ_FPS_Assets.zip?dl=0);
- You can find the tutorial on how to add a Unity project to Git here: [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpXxcvS-g3g);
